			<h1>  Farida Nimakwala</h1>
			<p><img class=" pull-left" style="margin-left: 25px;" src="images/faridaphoto3-copy_2.jpg" alt="">
				Farida is the Principal of School of Life. Armed with a then-fashionable MBA in Finance, she started her career in the investment advisory space. However, her life’s real mission and passion came along in the form of the pursuit of what could be her child’s ideal ‘education’. The dearth of options and the gaping lacunae that exposed themselves were both alarming and disturbing to her as a parent.</p>
			<p>Providentially, the Montessori method came her way then as an answer. An answer that has helped her ask many more questions since, about education and its place in life, and has driven her to seek better and more comprehensive answers to this enigma, answers that are worthy of our children and their well being.</p>
			<p>This journey has led Farida to embark on various endeavors from formal certification in Montessori, Teachers Training, the opening of her own school - House of Children - independently and within the ambit of a progressive High School, to jumping into a learning space with an open canvas of innovation and exploration. Places that gave her the freedom to follow the child and help them grow by the natural laws of nature, prepare them for life - by inspiring a love for learning and a readiness to change the world for the good.</p>
			<p>Farida's responsibilities of Principal, Founder, Teacher and Guide have thrown her way the rare privilege of working with children- from the curious little ones of two and three to the blossoming, burgeoning teenagers of sixteen, as also the promising persevering adults who are not yet too old to learn. She has tried to do her bit in widening of horizons through the study and teaching of topics and issues within myriad subjects, from Language to Mathematics, Business Studies to Human Culture, Practical life lessons to the Sciences; and learnt much in this attempt to ‘teach’.</p>
			<p>"It has been a quest worth taking</p>
			<p>And so Farida continues down this road with the inner satisfaction that any effort in the direction of understanding and unraveling the child will only take us further in being able to serve them."</p>

			<p> Krishan is the head of the Science department and the Senior School Coordinator at School of Life. This is what he has to say about his journey in the field of education.</p>
			<p>“Science is not just about finding answers. It’s about asking the right questions. As an educator, it has always been my endeavor to spark curiosity in my students and I have been committed to this cause for the past 12 years. During the course of completing my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering and working in the industry, I realized that education is not just a gateway to getting a secured job. It is much more than that and it was high time that we approached it with passion. I worked with schools to understand and eventually attempt to bridge this gap in teaching and learning Mathematics, Science and Environment. My role at School of Life further gives me the opportunity to expand the vision of true education with my team members. I would like to add with pride that in my heart I will always be a learner with my students.”.</p>
