			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>Our founders were dissatisfied with the mainstream system of education that heavily emphasises rote learning. School of Life was born out of their dedication to meaningful education. At School of Life, children are encouraged to explore and ideate and not blindly accept what is being taught. Respect for nature as well as one another, kindness and compassion, and above all, being open to new people, ideas and concepts are some of the highlights of the philosophy followed at School of Life.</p>
			<p>The team is a group of like-minded individuals who have come together to create a place that will cater not just to the academic aspect but also instill the values that will make our children good human beings. Our teachers have a warm and caring relationship with the students. The children, in turn, keep our teachers on their toes with their curiosity and enthusiasm.

			<h1>Our Methodology</h1>
			<p>We have a singular approach to education that includes many path-breaking policies such as No Competition, No Punishment and No Reward. Students are encouraged to achieve their highest level of excellence in each discipline. All our classroom sessions and activities are designed to enable children to become better versions of themselves.</p>
			<p>School of Life's biggest asset is the team of dedicated and motivated educators that ensures the children get high quality education. The teacher - student ratio is maintained at a low level in order to facilitate better understanding of the students and tailor the lessons to meet their needs.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Structured learning through experiment and experience leading to better retention and recall.</li>
				<li>No Homework, No Competition, No Rewards, No Punishment and No School-bag policy, which in turn leads to healthy collaboration. With growing confidence, children get better each day, better than they were before. They constantly improve their knowledge base, comprehension and writing skills plus habits of the mind, in action, and in community interactions.</li>
				<li>To equip students with the values needed to make them good human beings.</li>
				<li>Regular and qualitative assessments detect any hiccups in learning, to be addressed and remedied at the earliest level.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Just as flowers in a garden thrive in each other’s company, even taking from each other, helping others grow without the stress of having to outshine each other. Our students share information, views, ideas and resources, and in doing so help in each other’s learning.</p>
