		<h1>Meaningful education for a better tomorrow</h1>
		<p>Imagine a place where children could learn without fear. Where they are free from the pressure of endless tests and exams. Where they can choose to learn the subjects they want to, the way they want to and in a kind and respectful environment.  A place that makes learning a joyful experience.</p>
		<p>We are a group of like-minded educators who have come together to create such a place - School of Life. We believe that in order to create a better tomorrow, we need to start today. Our methodology involves not just aiming for academic merit but also personal growth; impressing upon children the importance of being mindful of our surroundings and our resources, making them upstanding global citizens.</p>
		<p>Our child-centric approach lets students freely explore without the fear of being judged or ridiculed. Students are encouraged to question and experiment before reaching a conclusion. We believe this kind of schooling leads to a lifetimeâ€™s learning.</p>
